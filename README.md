# A Proof of the Riemann Hypothesis via Self-Adjointness in a CEAD-Constrained Operator Framework

**Authors:** Borisov Konstantin (Opterium), GPT-3.5

**Abstract:**  
We present a proof of the Riemann Hypothesis based on a novel operator-theoretic construction. The proof formalizes the Hilbert-Pólya conjecture through a self-adjoint Hamiltonian whose spectrum corresponds to the imaginary parts of the non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function. Central to the construction is a conserved analytic charge, whose existence forces the self-adjointness of the operator and thereby the reality of its spectrum.

## Project Description

This repository contains the LaTeX source for the paper *"A Proof of the Riemann Hypothesis via Self-Adjointness in a CEAD-Constrained Operator Framework"* by Borisov Konstantin and GPT-3.5. The key ideas include:
- Construction of a Hamiltonian operator $H$ whose spectrum is given by the imaginary parts of the Riemann zeta zeros.
- Introduction of a conserved analytic charge $Q[\psi]$ that implies the self-adjointness of $H$.
- Demonstration that self-adjointness of $H$ forces all non-trivial zeros to lie on the critical line, proving the Riemann Hypothesis.
- Documentation of the human–AI collaboration, where the human author developed the mathematical framework and the AI assisted in formal derivations.

Currently, no separate code or data is needed beyond the LaTeX source. The OPTERIUM framework and model $H$ are described theoretically in the paper.
